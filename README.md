# Getting to grips with TDD in react

Following [this tutorial](https://learntdd.in/react/#setup) I wanted to gain a better understanding of how I would TDD in react. 

Use ``yarn start`` to run the project in development mode
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

Use ``yarn test`` to see the unit tests run and use ``yarn cypress:open`` to see the feature test run
